<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hi there! I'm a multi-talented individual with a variety of passions and skills. I'm a writer, artist, draughtsman, graphic designer, tattoo artist, introverted extrovert, web developer and dog mom.</p>

<p>I've always been fascinated by the creative process and love finding new ways to express my ideas and emotions. My desire to create has taken me on wonderful journeys over the years. From drawing sketches for client projects to designing graphics for websites, I've done it all!</p>
  
<p>Whatever project I take on, my goal is always to make sure that my work is unique and stays true to my own style. So if you're looking for someone creative who can bring your projects to life - look no further!</p>
